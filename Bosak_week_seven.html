            <h1>Nineteen Eighty-Four</h1>
            Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell is my favorite book.  I actually think of the
            book more as a horror novel than another genre.  What a terrifying society Orwell concocts!

            Here is an excerpt from Goodreads:  Among the seminal texts of the 20th century, Nineteen Eighty-Four is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory becomes more real. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmare vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life--the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language--and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written.<br><hr>
